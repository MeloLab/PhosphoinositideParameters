Changelog prior to version tracking:

#### LPBA(15052021)
Fixed Inositol bead type (SP4h -> SP4)

#### LPBA(01022021)
Added bead to center of inositol ring to better reflect the hydrophobic core.  

PI345P3 adjusted to increase stability and simplify the parameters.

Inositol sugar and Soluble Inositol headgroups added. 

ITP descriptions improved and mol graphs added.

#### LPBA(17122020)
Some bonded parameters have been adjusted to improve lipid SASA and APL.

Accessory bonds added to improve angles by avoiding clashes. 

PO4-GL1-GL2 now represented by 2 bonds (PO4-GL1 & PO4-GL2).

#### LPBA(11122020)
Same bonded parameters as before but the ring has been rotated. C1 is now 1C
and 2C.

C2 is now 6C and 5C, and finally, C3 is now 4C and 3C. Bonds added between
adjacent phosphates to account for some repulsions.

#### LPBA(26112020)
Bonded parameters updated. Phosphates now defined by 1bond, 1angle & 1dihedral.

More bonded freedom.
                  
#### LPBA(31082020)
PO lipids added.
                  
#### LPBA(18082020)
Parameterization targets adjusted to better reflect new martini3.0 rules. 

#### LPBA(03082020)
Phosphomonoester charges of mono-phosphorylated PIs changed to -2.0 to better
reflect their charge states in vivo at pH 7-7.4.

Phosphomonoester charges of bis-phosphorylated PIs changed to -1.5 to better
reflect their charge states in vivo at pH 7-7.4.
